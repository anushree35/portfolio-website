# My Portfolio Website

Hey! This is my personal portfolio website that I built to showcase my work and experience as a Computer Science student at UConn.

## What's in here

- **Dark theme design** - I went with a dark theme because it looks more modern and is easier on the eyes
- **Responsive layout** - Works on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Cool animations** - Added some floating shapes and hover effects to make it more interactive
- **Contact form** - People can reach out to me directly through the site
- **Project showcase** - Features my flight delay detector and ELA learning platform projects

## Files in this project

```
portfolio-website/
├── index.html          # Main page
├── styles.css          # All the styling and animations
├── script.js           # JavaScript for interactive stuff
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Tech stack I used

- **HTML5** - Basic structure
- **CSS3** - Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Interactive features and smooth scrolling
- **Font Awesome** - Icons
- **Google Fonts** - Inter font (looks clean and modern)

## What's on the website

The site has several sections:
1. **Home** - Introduction with my photo and basic info
2. **About Me** - My background, interests, and some stats
3. **Experience** - Timeline of my work and volunteer experience
4. **Projects** - My coding projects (flight delay detector, ELA platform)
5. **Skills** - Programming languages and tools I know
6. **Interests** - Personal hobbies and activities
7. **Contact** - Ways to reach me

## Cool features I added

- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Hover effects on everything (cards, buttons, text)
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Contact form with validation
- Floating background animations
- Text that moves when you hover over it

## How to run it locally

Just open `index.html` in your browser, or if you want to run it on a local server:

```bash
# Using Python (what I usually do)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js
npx serve .
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## How to customize it

If you want to use this as a template:
1. Edit `index.html` to change the content
2. Modify `styles.css` to change colors and styling
3. Update `script.js` if you want to add more interactive features
4. Replace the project links with your own

## Deploying the site

I deployed mine on Netlify (it's free and super easy):

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub to Netlify
3. Deploy from your repository
4. Done! Your site will be live at `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

You can also use:
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting directly from GitHub
- **Vercel** - Another great free option

## Mobile-friendly

The site works great on phones and tablets too - I made sure everything scales properly and the navigation works well on smaller screens.
